/* I can not get my Java Script functioning. 
I have read, watched and researched and still it will not work.
I even went so far as to copy something straight from a treehouse video and still it does not work.
I am sorry that I could not get it functioning but I did try.

You are welcome to enjoy some of my other failed attempts....  

function mouseOver() {
    document.getElementById("transition")event.target.style.color = "gray";
}
function mouseOut() {
    document.getElementById("transition")event.target.style.color = "white";
}



but wait there is more...

function MouseRollover(MyImage) {
        document.getElementByClass("nail").onmouseover = function() {mouseOver()
        MyImage.src = "cl.jpg";
    }
        function MouseOut(MyImage) {
        document.getElementByClass("nail").onmouseout = function() {mouseOut()
        MyImage.src = "cl.jpg";
    }
 
 
 
    
and more....
    
<button onclick="myFunction()">

.addEventListener("click")
.onclick=function(){
	document.getElementByClassName("button").innerHTML = "Thank you for contacting me!",
}




and more...

button.addEventListener('click', () {
alert("Thank you for contacting me");
}
    
    
    
I even took this one straight from a treehouse video...

transition.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
transition.textContent = transition.textContent.toUpperCase();});

transition.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
transition.textContent = transition.textContent.toLowerCase();});

-still did not work*/
