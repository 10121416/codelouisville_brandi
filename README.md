# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
My project is a one page website profiling who I am.
It is available for grading at
http://codelouisvilleproject.com/
and
https://github.com/10121416/codelouisville_brandi


My thoughts:
From a design point the biggest challenges were 
1.)getting the cards to line up side by side 
2.)collapsing issues
3.)I could not get my java script to work
4.)the parallax image does not work on an I-phone but the apple script described in the help wiki threw everything else out of whack.
From a coding perspective 
1.)I am sure it is not eloquently written 
2.)I worry I have some unnecessary css
3.)Some of my media query work is out of order but that was how I had to do it to get it to work.

My process:
I began my project with the Code Louisville front end template and bootstrap.
I finished my project with some graphic designs I had previously done for other websites and A LOT OF Googling.

## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. function name ex( animate() )
.. what function does ex( animate() is used to move the elements in the info div across the screen)

```
I added 3 java script functions for the form submission.
1.)getElementByClassName
2.)eventListener
3.)submit.form
I added multiple scripts throughout the entire site and I could never get any of them to work properly.
