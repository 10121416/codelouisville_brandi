# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description
```
My project is a one page website about who I am.

My thoughts:
From a design point it came out ok.  The biggest challenge was getting the cards to line up side by side and collapsing issues.
From a coding perspective I am sure it is not eloquently written and I worry I have some unnecessary css and some out of order media query work but that was how I had to do it to get it to work.

My process:
I began my project with the Code Louisville front end template and bootstrap.
I finished my project with some graphic designs I had previously done for other websites and A LOT OF Googling.

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
